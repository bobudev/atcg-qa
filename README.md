## Notes

- We were only able to do passes with the references we could gather.
- These may have been fixed already.
- We likely missed something.

### Recommended actions

- [ ] Revisit style guide with checklist
- [ ] Have multiple people do a full pass each with half starting from the beginning and half starting from the end. Fresh eyes are important for this. Automated checks can fail.
